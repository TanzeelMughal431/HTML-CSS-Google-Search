# Google Search Page Replica

This project is a replica of the iconic Google search page, designed and implemented using HTML and CSS. The HTML file (`index.html`) provides the structure of the page, while the CSS file (`style.css`) contains the styling to replicate the look and feel of the original Google search interface.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The page is designed to be responsive and adapt to various screen sizes, providing a seamless user experience across devices.
- **Navigation Menu:** Includes navigation links for "Gmail" and "Images", along with icons for additional functionalities.
- **Search Bar:** A search bar with a magnifying glass icon allows users to input search queries or URLs conveniently.
- **Buttons:** Two buttons, "Google Search" and "I'm Feeling Lucky", are provided for initiating search or exploring random results.

## Usage

To view the replica of the Google search page, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Credits

- **Font Awesome Icons:** Icons used in the project are sourced from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) library.
